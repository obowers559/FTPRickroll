This program attempts to log onto an FTP server using annonymous credentials.

If this fails, it brute forces the attack using a dictionary supplied by the user in the form:

Username1:Password1
Username2:Password2
...

If the program gains access to the FTP server, it injects malicious code into all ".php" ".htm" and ".asp" files
such that a link is added that redirects to the inimitable Rick Astley.


Enjoy.
